Cell Profiler project 
Purpose: measuring the percent occupancy of Bin1 signal within PV and Gad ROIs

Steps:
1. Identify Primary Objects (PVcells, GadCells, Bin1)
2. Threshold signal
3. Relate PV to Gad
4. Filter PV-positive and PV-negative Gad cells
5. Mask Bin1 signal by PV
6. Relate objects
7. Filter Bin1-positive and Bin1-negative PV cells
8. Mask Bin1 signal by Gad
9. Relate objects
10. Filter Bin1-positive and Bin1-negative Gad cells
11. Measure object intensity of thresholded images and identified objects
12. Measure Area occupied
13. Measure objects size and shape
14. Export relevant data


Project supplied to see chosen thresholds and steps of analysis. Any steps can be altered for various signals and new applications.
